Girls' Frontline Characters Image Download Tool

You can download from GF wiki of CN/EN/JP.

Currently only CN's Girls' Frontline wiki has a specific naming rule for the characters image, and therefore these can be specifically downloaded. For other wikis, all `png` files have to be downloaded and it's a huge amount of files.
Also, JP's wiki has a slow speed, at least for the network here.

Features:

1. Support filenames in none-english characters.
2. For 404 and other network-error files, a blank file with the file name will be created.
